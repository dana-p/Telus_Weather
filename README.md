# Telus_Weather
React App that tells you the weather in a city. Test for Telus. 


### Developer Assignment

Using the free Dark Sky API, create a simple React weather app that allows the user to search for a city and display the real-time weather for that city.

Try to use as many components as you find necessary (for instance to capture text input, use the Input component) from the TELUS Design System:

Beyond these basic requirements, this app is very open-ended. You may use any packages you want to support this application.

It's up to you to determine the scope or complexity of the app. We want to understand your process of learning a new technology, breaking down a problem, and how you articulate that to us.
